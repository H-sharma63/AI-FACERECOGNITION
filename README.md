# Face Recognition using Pre-Trained Model ðŸŽ¯

A Python-based face recognition program that uses a pre-trained model to identify known individuals from a webcam feed. The system works in real time and is limited to recognizing the people it was originally trained on.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- Real-time webcam face detection and recognition
- Works only for the people it was pre-trained on
- Uses OpenCV and Haar cascade classifiers
- Great for experimenting with computer vision basics

## ðŸ§  Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Haar Cascades
- Numpy

## ðŸš€ Usage

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/H-sharma63/AI-FACERECOGNITION.git
cd AI-FACERECOGNITION
pip install -r requirements.txt
